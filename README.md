# Ableton-Drum-Racks

I got tired of constantly having to reference the kontakt plugin window to find what drums mapped to which notes. 
AFter a short websearch I found the following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOAVgavxaz0 that lead to making this rack
Hopefully someone will find it useful.
The rack was created using the Abby Roads Modern Drumer Kontakt instrument. Have not tested it with other Kontakt kits yet.
