# Ableton-Drum-Racks

I got tired of constantly having to reference the plugin windows and hit or miss on the piano roll to find what drums mapped to which notes. 
This drum rack is for Superior Drummer 3. All that you should need to do is drop the actual plugin on the first chain that's labled Superior Drummer. 

Enjoy
